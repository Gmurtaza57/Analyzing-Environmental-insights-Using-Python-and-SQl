  - üî¨ Project: Analyzing Environmental Insights for 53K Readings
üîß Tools: Python, MySQL, Pandas
üìä Data: Environmental monitoring dataset

‚úÖ Extracted insights from 53K environmental readings.
‚úÖ Cleaned, preprocessed, and quality assured the dataset.
‚úÖ Renamed columns for clearer descriptions.
‚úÖ Handled null values, duplicates, and missing data.
‚úÖ Converted data types for accurate analysis.
‚úÖ Exported the cleaned dataset to SQL server for further use.


üåê SQL Queries:
 1Ô∏è‚É£ Average temperature recorded for each device.
 2Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 devices with highest average carbon monoxide levels.
 3Ô∏è‚É£ Average temperature recorded in the dataset.
 4Ô∏è‚É£ Timestamp and temperature of highest recorded temperature for each device.
 5Ô∏è‚É£ Devices where temperature increased from minimum to maximum recorded.
 6Ô∏è‚É£ Exponential moving average of temperature for each device (limited to 10 devices).
 7Ô∏è‚É£ Timestamps and devices with carbon monoxide levels exceeding average.
 8Ô∏è‚É£ Devices with highest average temperature recorded.
 9Ô∏è‚É£ Average temperature for each hour of the day across devices.
üîü Device(s) with only a single distinct temperature value.
 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Devices with highest humidity levels.
 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Average temperature for each device, excluding outliers.
 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Devices that experienced sudden change in humidity (\>50% difference) within 30 minutes.
 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Average temperature for each device during weekdays and weekends.
 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Cumulative sum of temperature for each device, ordered by timestamp (limited to 10 records)
